___

## Highlights
- The behavioral results can be best fitted by a multi-attribute time-dependent drift diffusion model (tDDM), in which self-interest and self-consistency had different onset timings and drift rates.
- Univariate analysis on the fMRI data showed significant activations in regions related to cognitive control and reward in the dishonesty condition.
- The drift rates of reward and the related brain regions were correlated to the respective ROIs, which was further confirmed through fMRI functional connectivity analysis.
